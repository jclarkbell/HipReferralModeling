OHS if  then

Pre op OHS score has hard boundary between 18 and 30 for getting surgery
Thoughts:
- simulate 4 year outcomes on large data sample and then use that for training and smaller sample as test set
- population simulation of scores < 40 (currently not requiring surgery)
- examination of rate of decay in patients as mitigating factor for decision/ modeling feature
- some method of best allocating resources, assuming they are currently inefficient, lagragian/ secondary treatment clustering


The use of patient-reported outcome measures to guide referral for hip and knee arthroplasty (price-kang)
- anthroplasties tend to improve cases quality of life by 10-20%
- referred after nonoperative care doesn't aleiviate pain
- OHS completed preoperatively and 6 months post surgery
- patients with higher scores have less capacity to benefit (proven by Who should have knee joint replacement surgery for osteoarthritis?
Paul DIEPPE,Keith LIM,Stefan LOHMANDER) "however decision needs to be individualised"
- no published evidence about what level is best
- datasets "the NHS patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) dataset 2009-2015 was used
- can we get the 200,000 patient dataset??

- fractional polynomial logit reg used, AUC calculated to determine discrimination - covariates used were: age, sex, 12 patient reported comorbities (heart diseas, high blood pressure, problems caused by stroke, ...)
- Quantile regression, had a third degree polynomial form and robust variances, probability of meaningful improvement calculated in percentiles, "GIVEN THE VERY LARGE SIZE OF THE AVAILABLE DATASET"
- "above 40 there is by definition a zero probability of meaningful improvement, since these patients cannot achieve an eight point improvement on the 48-point prob scale" - where 8 points is consituted as meaningful improvement


Arthiritis research UK
- 1 in 9 adutlts over the age of 45 has osteoarthiritis of the hip (10-12% depending on local authority)
- indicators: 
	- excess weight, active and inactive percentages, smoking
- risk factors: increasing age, female sex, genetic factors and previous joint injury, obesity
- 

Exeter study:
- smaller dataset but longer evaluation period

The use of patient-reported outcome measures to guide referral for hip and knee anthroplasty:
- cost of nonsurgerical treatment vs surgical treatment
- base case analysis score of 45/48
